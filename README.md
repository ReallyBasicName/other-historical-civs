this mod will add new historical civs into unciv.

Some planned civilizations (in no order): Prussia, Western Rome, Holy Roman Empire, Mali, Croatia

Finished: Norway



Rough early draft of these civilizations:

Croatia - Stronger coastal cities? Probably more cuz thats pretty weak. Probably more defensive bonuses?

Mali - Money.
