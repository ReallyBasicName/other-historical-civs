this mod will add new historical civs into unciv.

Some planned civilizations (in no order): Prussia, Croatia, Kushan, Alans

Finished: Norway, Mali, Holy Romans, Western Romans, Wales, Aragon



Rough early draft of these civilizations:

Croatia - Stronger coastal cities? Probably more cuz thats pretty weak. Probably more defensive bonuses?
